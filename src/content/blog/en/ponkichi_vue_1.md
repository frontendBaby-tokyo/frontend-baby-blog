## Episode 1: A Mysterious Encounter in the Lab

In an old Western-style house deep in the forest, Dr. Frontend was wrestling with some tricky code down in his underground laboratory.

“Hmm... How can I explain this type definition more clearly...?”

Just as he scratched his head, a knock sounded at the lab’s door.

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Oh? Who could it be at this hour?”

He opened the door and found a small raccoon dog standing there, clutching a thick programming book.

**Ponkichi:**
“Excuse me! My name is Ponkichi. I want to become a frontend engineer, so I’ve been studying Vue.js, but…”

Ponkichi’s eyes glistened with worry.

**Ponkichi:**
“I can write a little bit about components and the basics, but every time I start, there’s always this ‘createApp’ thing. What exactly does it do? The books just say, ‘It’s a function that creates your app’ and that’s it...
The other animals in the forest told me, ‘That doctor knows everything,’ so I decided to visit you.”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Well, well! A young raccoon dog who wants to become a frontend engineer! How interesting. Come on in, come in.”

*With sparkling eyes, Ponkichi entered the lab. The walls were lined with monitors, each displaying colorful code.*

**Ponkichi:**
“Wow! Amazing! Are all of these programs?”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“That’s right. So, you want to learn Vue.js?”

**Ponkichi:**
“Yes! I’ve started to understand components and data binding a little, but I have no idea what ‘createApp’ really means, even though I always write it at the beginning…”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Haha! You’re already writing components? Impressive! But you’re right—most people just write ‘createApp’ like it’s some sort of magic spell, without really understanding what it does.”

**Ponkichi:**
“Exactly! I write `import { createApp } from 'vue'` and then call `createApp`, but I just can’t sleep at night wondering what this function actually does!”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“I see, I see. In that case, let me teach you the very first, most important step of making an application with Vue.js—the magic incantation that starts it all.”

Dr. Frontend stood in front of a large monitor and began typing on the keyboard.

```javascript
import { h, createApp } from "@vue/runtime-dom";

const App = {
  render() {
    return h("div", "Hello, Ponkichi!");
  },
};
createApp(App).mount("#app");
```

**Dr. Frontend:**
“This is it. Just these few lines are the magic that brings a Vue.js application to life.”

**Ponkichi:**
“Huh...? This is a bit different from what I’m used to. I usually write things like `template` and `data`, but what’s this `h`? And I’ve never seen a `render` function before...”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Good eye! Yes, this might look a little different from the examples you’re used to. But don’t worry—you’ll understand what the `h` function and `render` are soon enough. Today, let’s focus on understanding the basics of `createApp`.”

**Ponkichi:**
“Okay... But what exactly does this `createApp` function do?”

Dr. Frontend grinned and pointed to a nearby browser window, where the words “Hello, Ponkichi!” were displayed.

**Ponkichi:**
“Wow! That’s my name!”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“See? This `createApp` function is what brought your application to life.”

**Ponkichi:**
“‘createApp’... I know it means ‘create application,’ but what is it actually doing? How is it different from the components I usually write?”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Great question! ‘Create’ means to make something, and ‘App’ stands for ‘application.’ But, as you said, what it actually *does* is what matters.”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“The components you usually write are like the ‘ingredients’ for a recipe. But `createApp` is the special function that combines all those ingredients into one complete ‘dish’—it’s like preparing the plate or bowl that holds your meal.”

Ponkichi blinked in surprise.

**Ponkichi:**
“The plate...? So, components and applications are different things?”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Exactly! Components are like the ingredients in a recipe. But `createApp` prepares the ‘plate’ or ‘bowl’—the container for your application. No matter how good your ingredients are, you need something to put them on, right?”

Dr. Frontend started drawing on the chalkboard:

```
Put the components (ingredients) in  
      ↓  
[ createApp function ]  
      ↓  
The application (the finished plate)
```

**Dr. Frontend:**
“By placing your component ‘ingredients’ into the application ‘bowl,’ you end up with a complete, delicious dish—your web app!”

**Ponkichi:**
“I get it! So the `data` and `template` I always write are the ingredients, and `createApp` puts them all together into an app ‘bowl’!”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“That’s right! And once the bowl is ready, you use `mount('#app')` to actually serve it up on the screen.”

Ponkichi’s face lit up with understanding, and he began hopping up and down.

**Ponkichi:**
“Boing! I get it now! That `createApp` I always wrote without thinking was a super important function that turns components into an application bowl!”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Exactly! But actually, there are even deeper secrets to `createApp`.”

**Ponkichi:**
“Secrets? What kind of secrets?”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“For example, if you try to pass the wrong kind of component, it will tell you ‘that’s not right!’ This is done with a mechanism called TypeScript’s ‘types.’”

**Ponkichi:**
“Types...?”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Yep! Don’t worry about the details for now—it’s your first day, after all. But ‘types’ are a way of labeling data, like putting a tag on it that says ‘this is a string’ or ‘this is a number.’”

*Ponkichi scribbled notes with all his might.*

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Next time, why don’t we try building a Vue app together on your own computer?”

**Ponkichi:**
“I’d love to! But... will I really be able to do it?”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Of course! Everyone starts as a beginner. What matters is curiosity and taking one step at a time.”

Ponkichi wagged his tail in delight.

**Ponkichi:**
“Thank you, Doctor! Can I come back again tomorrow?”

**Dr. Frontend:**
“Of course! Next time, you’ll get to write `createApp` yourself. And we’ll look a bit more closely at the magic behind it.”

**Ponkichi:**
“Yay! I can’t wait! Boing!”

*Ponkichi left the lab, bursting with excitement for tomorrow’s lesson. Dr. Frontend, too, looked happy to have a new apprentice.*

### 🌟 Today's Takeaways

* **`createApp`** is the magic function that creates a Vue.js application
* Just like a recipe, if you provide the right ingredients (settings), you’ll get an app
* **TypeScript types** are like labels for your data, helping prevent mistakes
* Programming is something anyone can learn, step by step!

### 👨‍🏫 Doctor’s Note

Ponkichi may not have noticed yet, but today’s code used an unusual import:
`import { h, createApp } from "@vue/runtime-dom";`

Normally, most documentation uses `import { createApp } from 'vue'`.
So, why did I deliberately import from `@vue/runtime-dom` this time?

Actually, the ‘vue’ package Ponkichi usually uses is made up of several smaller packages. Among them, `@vue/runtime-dom` provides the essential features needed to run Vue apps in the browser, like the renderer and DOM manipulation APIs.

In other words, when you write `import { createApp } from 'vue'`, Vue is internally bringing in `createApp` from `@vue/runtime-dom` for you.

Today, I wanted you to get a sense of Vue’s internal structure, so I had us import directly from the core.
Someday, I’ll explain all about `@vue/runtime-dom` in a special bonus episode. For now, just remember—there’s a whole world hidden behind the ‘vue’ package you use every day!
