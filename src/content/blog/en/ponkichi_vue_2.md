## Episode 2: First createApp Experience and the Mystery of the h Function

The next day, as promised, Ponkichi arrived at Dr. Frontend's laboratory.

**Ponkichi:**
"Good morning, Doctor! Thank you for having me again today! Boing!"

Seeing Ponkichi's boundless energy, the doctor smiled warmly.

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Ah, good morning, Ponkichi. Did you review what we learned yesterday?"

**Ponkichi:**
"Yes! `createApp` is a super important function that combines components‚Äîthe 'ingredients'‚Äîinto an application 'container,' right?"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Exactly! You remembered it well. Now then, today let's have you try using `createApp` with your own hands."

The doctor seated Ponkichi in front of the monitor.

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Here's the code I showed you yesterday. Now, try writing it yourself."

```javascript
import { h, createApp } from "@vue/runtime-dom";

const App = {
  render() {
    return h("div", "Hello, Ponkichi!");
  },
};
createApp(App).mount("#app");
```

Ponkichi nervously but diligently began typing on the keyboard. Though his fingers were unsteady at first, with the doctor's guidance, he managed to finish writing the code.

**Ponkichi:**
"I did it! Doctor!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Well done! Now, let's run it."

When Ponkichi pressed Enter, the browser displayed "Hello, Ponkichi!"

**Ponkichi:**
"Yay! The code I wrote actually works! Boing! Boing!"

Ponkichi was so happy that he started hopping up and down.

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Ha ha ha! That's the true joy of programming. There's nothing quite like the moment when your own code comes to life."

After celebrating for a while, Ponkichi suddenly had a question.

**Ponkichi:**
"Doctor, I was wondering yesterday too‚Äîwhat exactly is this `h` function? How is it different from writing with `template` like I usually do?"

The doctor nodded as if he'd been waiting for this question.

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Excellent question, Ponkichi! That's precisely the key to understanding Vue.js's inner workings."

**Dr. Frontend:**
"The `template` you usually use is actually converted internally by Vue.js into code that uses this `h` function."

**Ponkichi:**
"What?! Really?!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Indeed. While `template` is an easy-to-understand way of writing for humans, what Vue.js truly understands are things called 'Virtual Nodes' or 'VNodes' created by this `h` function."

**Ponkichi:**
"Virtual nodes...?"

The doctor began drawing on the blackboard again.

```
<template>
  <div>Hello</div>
</template>

      ‚Üì Vue.js converts this to

h('div', 'Hello')
```

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Code written in `template` is ultimately converted into a form using the `h` function and passed to Vue.js. You could say the `h` function is like Vue.js's 'common language.'"

**Ponkichi:**
"I see! So we can write with the `h` function directly instead of using `template`!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Exactly! And to understand the inner workings of Vue.js‚Äîthe true nature of the 'magic'‚Äîlearning from this `h` function is the best shortcut."

**Ponkichi:**
"The `h` function... It sounds difficult, but interesting too!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"With that curiosity, you'll be just fine. Next time, let's explore the mysterious world of this `h` function and the 'virtual nodes' it creates in more detail."

**Ponkichi:**
"Yes! I'm looking forward to it! Boing!"

Ponkichi left the laboratory, excited about this new magical incantation called the `h` function.

### üåü Today's Takeaways

- Experienced creating an application by writing **`createApp`** yourself.
- The **`template`** we usually use is internally converted to the **`h` function**.
- The **`h` function** is the key to understanding Vue.js's inner workings.

### Next Episode Preview: "The Mysterious World of the h Function and VNodes"

Ponkichi learns how to use the h function and uncovers the mysteries of Vue.js's magical ingredient: "VNodes (Virtual Nodes)"!

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Doctor's Note

To make the story easier to understand, the doctor explained that "templates are converted to h functions," but technically, it's a bit different.

Vue's compiler first parses the template (converting it to a tree structure called an AST), then generates optimized rendering code from there. The `h` function is a convenient API we developers use when we want to manually write rendering logic, while the code the compiler ultimately generates is even more optimized.

In this story, I used the term "h function" as a representative concept to make it easier for Ponkichi to understand.
By the way, this "h" stands for "hyperscript," which is a type of "notation for describing virtual DOM trees in JavaScript." The same concept is used in React as well.
