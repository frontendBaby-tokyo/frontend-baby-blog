## Episode 7: What is the Component Type?

Having learned that `createApp` is protected by strict type definitions, Ponkichi eagerly visits the lab today to unravel the mystery of the `Component` type‚Äîthe argument passed to `createApp`.

**Ponkichi:**
"Doctor! Please teach me about the `Component` type! It's about those objects we always write, right?"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Indeed, that's correct, Ponkichi. The `Component` type is the 'blueprint' for parts in Vue.js. It defines the 'ideal form' of the object where we write `data`, `methods`, `computed`, and other properties‚Äîthat's what the `Component` type is."

The doctor displayed an example of a `Component` type object on the monitor.

```javascript
const MyComponent = {
  props: {
    name: String
  },
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello!'
    }
  },
  methods: {
    greet() {
      alert(this.message + ' ' + this.name)
    }
  },
  computed: {
    reversedName() {
      return this.name.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
}
```

**Dr. Frontend:**
"This object is one concrete example of the `Component` type. You can see it's packed with familiar properties like `props`, `data`, and `methods`."

**Ponkichi:**
"Ah! I recognize those words‚Äî`data` and `methods`! I mostly write in the `<script setup>` format, so seeing everything combined into one object like this is fresh for me. But the keywords being used are similar! So these are the rules defined by the `Component` type!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Exactly! The `Component` type is like a big container that defines the rules: 'If you're a Vue component, you're allowed to have these kinds of properties.'"

The doctor drew the conceptual structure of the `Component` type on the blackboard.

```typescript
// Component type concept (simplified version)
interface Component {
  props?: object | string[];
  data?: (this: ComponentPublicInstance) => object;
  methods?: { [key: string]: Function };
  computed?: { [key: string]: Function | { get: Function; set: Function } };
  setup?: (props: Props, context: SetupContext) => object | Function;
  // ...and many more!
}
```

**Ponkichi:**
"Wow! Sure enough, there are lots of names I recognize like `props` and `data`! There's `setup` too!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"That's right. Thanks to this `Component` type, when we accidentally write `metods` instead of `methods`, or write `data` as an object instead of a function, TypeScript will tell us, 'That violates the rules of the `Component` type!'"

**Ponkichi:**
"I see! Because there's a `Component` template, we can catch mistakes!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Exactly. This is somewhat similar to object-oriented thinking. It's the concept of predetermining what kind of data (properties) and what kind of behaviors (methods) a 'thing' (object) with a specific role should have."

**Ponkichi:**
"Properties and methods...?"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Yes. Roughly speaking, things like `data` that represent 'state and information' are properties, and functions inside `methods` that represent 'actions and processing' are methods."

Ponkichi was deeply convinced to learn that the components he had been writing were built upon the solid foundation of the `Component` type definition.

**Ponkichi:**
"So components aren't just ordinary objects‚Äîthey're special parts that follow rules set by Vue.js! Boing!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"That's right! And actually, this `Component` type, like the `createApp` type definition we saw last time, has an even deeper form that uses generics."

**Ponkichi:**
"What?! Those `<...>` things are coming up again?!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Hehe. Let's save that discussion for next time. Next time, we'll explore the mystery of the seven mysterious parameters that the `Component` type possesses."

**Ponkichi:**
"Seven of them?! Yes, I'm curious!"

Ponkichi's exploration is getting closer and closer to the heart of Vue.js and TypeScript.

### üåü Today's Takeaways

- The **`Component` type** is like a "blueprint" that defines the properties (`data`, `props`, etc.) that Vue components should have.
- Thanks to this type, TypeScript can check for mistakes in writing components.
- The "state and information" that objects have are sometimes called **properties**, and "actions and processing" are called **methods**.
- The components we always write are special objects protected by the `Component` type.

### Next Episode Preview: "Seven Mysterious Parameters"
The `Component` type is actually a complex type with seven generic parameters: `Component<P, B, D, C, M, E, S>`! Let's uncover the identity of these mysterious letters together with Ponkichi!

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Doctor's Note

Ponkichi might be feeling a bit anxious about the "seven mysterious parameters" mentioned in the next episode preview. But don't worry! Let me secretly reveal their identity just a little bit today.

Actually, the formal definition of the `Component` type looks like this:

```typescript
Component<P, B, D, C, M, E, S>
```

These seven letters each represent important elements of Vue components:

- **P** = **Props** (Properties) - Data received from the parent
- **B** = **RawBindings** (Raw Bindings) - Values returned from the setup function
- **D** = **Data** (Data) - Component state
- **C** = **Computed** (Computed Properties) - Values calculated and derived
- **M** = **Methods** (Methods) - Component behaviors
- **E** = **Emits** (Events) - Messages sent to the parent
- **S** = **Slots** (Slots) - Parts where content can be swapped out

The `data` and `methods` that Ponkichi has been writing are actually part of this big blueprint!

The "object properties and methods" we talked about today actually correspond to D (Data) and M (Methods). And the variables and functions that Ponkichi usually writes in `<script setup>` are also properly managed by this type system.

Of course, there's no need to memorize all seven right now. As long as Ponkichi continues writing components as usual, Vue.js will handle all this complex type management behind the scenes.

Interestingly, these seven parameters were gradually added as Vue.js evolved. It started much simpler but developed into a more flexible and powerful type system to meet developers' needs.

But someday, when Ponkichi thinks, "I want to create more complex components" or "I want to build large apps with a team," being able to be conscious of these seven elements will help him reach the next level as a true **component designer**.
