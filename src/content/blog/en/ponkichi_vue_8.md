## Episode 8: Seven Mysterious Parameters

Having learned that the `Component` type is the blueprint for Vue components, Ponkichi was still curious about the doctor's words that "there's an even deeper form to it."

**Ponkichi:**
"Doctor! Hello! Please tell me about the deeper secrets that the Component type holds!"

The doctor grinned and displayed the complete form of the `Component` type on the monitor.

```typescript
interface Component<Props, RawBindings, Data, Computed, Methods, Emit, Slots> {
  // ...
}
```

**Ponkichi:**
"Whoa! There it is‚Äîthat spell-like thing again! `Props`, `RawBindings`, `Data`... There are so many letters lined up... Are these the seven parameters you mentioned, Doctor?"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"That's right, Ponkichi. At first glance, it might look like just a complex cipher. But this is the magical key that allows TypeScript to accurately understand the internals of Vue components."

Ponkichi tilted his head with a confused expression.

**Ponkichi:**
"Why do we need so many parameters...? Wouldn't just a simple `Component` type be enough?"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Good question. For example, when you write `this` inside a component's `methods`, how do you think TypeScript knows what `this` contains?"

**Ponkichi:**
"Um...? Properties returned by `data`, or `props`...?"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"Exactly! `this` can access various elements of the component like `data`, `props`, `methods`, and `computed`. These seven parameters are precisely for telling Vue and TypeScript accurately what shape the `Props` take, what shape the `Data` takes, what the `Methods` are like, and so on for each part."

The doctor explained while pointing to the first letters of each parameter:

- **`Props`**: The type of `props` passed from the parent
- **`Data`**: The type of the object returned by the `data()` function
- **`Computed`**: The type of `computed` properties
- **`Methods`**: The type of the `methods` object

**Dr. Frontend:**
"By passing this type information as generics, Vue can accurately understand 'Ah, the `this` of this component has these properties and methods.' As a result, when we write `this.message`, it can tell us the type of `message`, and if we make a typo like `this.mesage`, it will scold us saying 'No such property exists!'"

Ponkichi realized that what seemed like just a complex array of letters was actually a very precise blueprint that worked with each part of the component to enable TypeScript's powerful type checking.

**Ponkichi:**
"Amazing...! Because of these parameters, TypeScript can understand the contents of my components as if it can see right through them! Boing!"

**Dr. Frontend:**
"That's right! This complexity has a proper reason. You don't need to memorize everything at once. Let's gradually uncover what kind of magic each of these parameters uses, one by one."

**Ponkichi:**
"Yes! First, I want to know about the magic of `Props`!"

To Ponkichi's eyes, the cipher in front of him looked like a treasure map waiting to be deciphered.

### üåü Today's Takeaways

- The **`Component` type** was actually a complex type with seven **generic parameters**.
- These parameters are for defining the types of each part of the component, like `Props`, `Data`, and `Methods`.
- Because of this detailed type information, TypeScript can accurately infer the type of `this` and provide powerful type checking.
- Complex-looking things have meaningful reasons hidden behind them!

### Next Episode Preview: "The Magic of Props"

`Props` play an important role in connecting data between parent and child components. How are their types defined, and how is safety maintained by TypeScript? We'll finally start uncovering the mysteries of the parameters one by one!

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Doctor's Note

To make the story easier to understand, the doctor explained the `Component` type as a simple form with seven generic parameters, but in reality, the actual type definition is much more complex.

```typescript
export type Component<PropsOrInstance = any, RawBindings = any, D = any, C extends ComputedOptions = ComputedOptions, M extends MethodOptions = MethodOptions, E extends EmitsOptions | Record<string, any[]> = {}, S extends Record<string, any> = any> = ConcreteComponent<PropsOrInstance, RawBindings, D, C, M, E, S> | ComponentPublicInstanceConstructor<PropsOrInstance>;
```

The actual type is a "union type" where several types are combined, and even more advanced TypeScript features are used. But if Ponkichi tried to understand all of that at this stage, he would get confused.

What's important is grasping the concept that these seven parameters represent the types of the main parts of components (Props, Data, Methods, etc.). In this story, we prioritize understanding that essence.
